        </header>

        <h2 class='arial'>Overall Introduction</h2>
        <p class='arial'>Our dashboard sets out to examine the sales performance, customer behavior, and shipping trends
            within the Superstore dataset which contains nearly 10,000 customer transactions across the United States.
            We want to analyze how region, product category, customer segment, and shipping method influence both sales
            and profitability. Our visualizations are a Sankey diagram to trace profit flow, a treemap breaking
            down category and sub-category level sales by region and state, a Geopandas map highlighting state-by-state profitability,
            and a D3 bar chart analyzing shipping class usage. These visualizations were created using Geopandas,
            Altair, and D3.js to provide both static and interactive insights. Our project specifically targets
            questions of which states drive the most revenue, what customer segments are the most valuable, and how
            shipping choices reflect consumer behavior. The goal is to transform these patterns into actionable insights
            for business areas such as inventory planning, regional marketing strategies, and logistics optimization.
        </p>

        <h2 class = 'arial'>Data Introduction</h2>
        <p class = 'arial'>Our data was collected from a public Kaggle dataset that represents customer orders from a large store, 
            specifically where the customer is located and what they bought. The corresponding data frame has 9994 rows 
            (observations) and 21 columns (features). Customer address, product categories and subcategories, and sales are provided. 
            This data allows us to explore questions like which products sell the most in certain regions, which regions bring in 
            the largest amount of revenue, and the most popular shipping methods per region. We can uncover trends that help 
            businesses make smarter decisions, like figuring out which products to promote more. Plus, this information is relevant 
            because these kinds of insights are also applicable to many retail businesses as well.

            <iframe class='center-iframe-container' src="m_profit.html" width="100%" height="1000px"
                style="border:black;"></iframe>
            <p class="arial">This plot shows all US sales, profit, and bestselling categories from the Superstore in
                each state. At a
                glance, the profit is displayed by heat-map style of colors for 48 states depending on their profits,
                with the legend on the left alerts the viewer of a state's relative profit. When you hover over a state,
                a viewer is given more in-depth data based on the state's profit, sales, and bestselling category. </p>
            <p class='arial'>Analyzing the plot, it is clear that California and New York are by large the Superstore's
                most profitable states, with $152M and $83M profits respectively. This makes most other states, even if they
                are profitable, look minuscule in comparison through their orange color. It also displays how
                unprofitable Texas is, with it losing $25M worth of profit, emphasized by its bright red color. It is
                also worth mentioning that the majority of the best-selling category is in office supplies, which is
                most likely because of their high-volume demand and low cost compared to other categories. This graph is
                particularly useful for finding where business successes and liabilities are, along with getting
                analysis on a state-by-state basis. </p>

                what demographic of buyer each state benefits from the most. </p>
            <p class='arial'>In this case, California and New York take up the majority of the traffic in the west and
                east
                respectively, while other states pick up the rest of the profit. It's also important to note that
                consumer purchases are the Superstore's largest segment of profit, with it being more than both
                corporate and home office purchases combined. Based on the sanskey, it seems it would be particularly
                useful to continue targeting the consumer bases in their big demographics in the east and west to
                maximize profits. </p>

            <p class='arial'>This treemap is meant to display the categories and subcategories of products within each region 
                and state of the USA. The map is interactive, and if you hover ovesr a node/box, that node's label, parent node's 
                label, and sales are shown. By default, 2 node levels are shown (for readability), and the user can click on a node 
                to see the deeper levels. For instance, on the baseplot on the webpage, we can see the Region and State 
                (by sales), but if you click on a state's box/node, you can see the state and the categories by sales. Then, you 
                can see the subcategories if you click on a category box/node. Also, the parent nodes in the hierarchy are shown in 
                order at the top. You can "zoom back out" by clicking on the names of a parent node, or the current node. For the 
                colorblind folks, the West region section is blue, East is red, Central is green, and South is purple.
            </p>
            <p class='arial'>California appears to be the state with the most sales by far overall and by category, followed closely
                by New York, with $458k and $310k in sales respectively. Thanks to California, the Western USA is the region with 
                the most sales, followed closely by Eastern, and later by the Central and South regions. The Southern region 
                accounts for roughly half the sales of the largest Western region.

            </p>
            <p class='arial'>There is a clear peak roughly in mid-March for technology sales at a little more than 24,000 on March 18
                2014. Around that time, Facebook accuired Oculus VR, which is the company that developed the famed Oculus Rift 
                Virtual Reality headset, and perhaps there was increased marketing for various tech products. Peaks by category are 
                in April and October in each year for Technology and September 2016 for furniture, which might suggest seasonal 
                demand for spring and fall as new phones are released. Of note, the Technology category appears to show the sharpest 
                spikes, indicating likely major promotional events and large orders. Furniture and office supplies sales 
                occasionally peak but are usually stable.

                style="border:black;"></iframe>
            <p class='arial'>This barchart uses the D3 library to display superstore sales categorized by product type
                and shopping class.
                Second class is represented by green, standard class is represented by orange, first class is
                represented by blue, and on the same day is pink.
                The x-axis represents the three main different product types from the superstore. The y-axis represents
                the volume of the shipping method used.</p>
            <p class='arial'>Looking at the barchart we notice a few trends across the data. First, for every single
                product category, standard class leads in sales.
                This makes it the most popular shipping category either for economic reasons or convenience.
                We then see second class falling behind standard class at roughly ⅓ of standard class.
                We then see first class as the third most popular option. There is an interesting observation to be made in the technology product category,
                as second class and first class roughly have the same amount of volume. This could be as a result of consumers wanting their technology protected and delivered quickly.
                We see same day shipping in the last palace for the bar plot possibly due to the high cost and frequency of use. </p>

            <ul class='myUL'>
                <li>Standard Class is the most used shipping method across all product categories, likely due to cost or convenience.</li>
                <li>First Class and Second Class trail behind, with Second Class showing a notable spike in Technology.</li>
                <li>Same Day shipping is the least used, possibly due to its high cost or limited demand.</li>

        <h2 class = 'arial'>Summary of Findings</h2>
        <p class = 'arial'>After analysis of our data via visualizations, many of our assumptions were supported by our findings. 
                        The west and east regions dominate profit margins for the Superstore, with California and New York 
                        accounting for over 50% of profit in the US. It is also worth noting that many southern states, particularly 
                        Texas, are in the red, bleeding profit at a very high rate despite sales. If we were the Superstore, our 
                        goal would be to focus research on the south to better understand why profits are poor (we believe it must be 
                        due to the category of sales made). Our findings show that office supplies are best sellers because of their 
                        price/demand ratio. </p>
        <div class="plot-container">
            <ul class='myUL'>
                <li>California and New York dominate US profit, while Texas is very far in the red</li>
                <li>Data is useful to make future business decisions for minimizing southern losses/maximizing profits</li>
                <li>Office supplies are best sellers because of their price/demand ratio</li>
                <li>Technology has the best returns but can be costly as demonstrated in Texas</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class = 'arial'>Improvements for Further Analysis</h2>
        <p class = 'arial'>In future analysis of this data, designing a map that can better find the split of 
            categories/sub-categories by purchase would be an objective. This could help gain a more concrete understanding of why 
            a product sells well or poorly. These types of visualizations, along with the aid of a predictive model, would be the 
            next step to understanding the data given and making predictions in the future based on said findings. </p>
