            <h3>Geopandas Profit Plot</h3>
            <iframe src="m_profit.html" width="100%" height="1000px" style="border:black;"></iframe>
            <p>This plot shows all US sales, profit, and bestselling categories from the Superstore in each state. At a
                glance, the profit is displayed by heat-map style of colors for 48 states depending on their profits,
                with the legend on the left alerts the viewer of a state’s relative profit. When you hover over a state,
                a viewer is given more in-depth data based on the state’s profit, sales, and bestselling category. </p>
            <p>Analyzing the plot, it is clear that California and New York are by large the Superstore's most
                profitable states, with $152M and $83M profits respectively. This makes most other states, even if they
                are profitable, look minuscule in comparison through their orange color. It also displays how
                unprofitable Texas is, with it losing $25M worth of profit, emphasized by its bright red color. It is
                also worth mentioning that the majority of the best-selling category is in office supplies, which is
                most likely because of their high-volume demand and low cost compared to other categories. This graph is
                particularly useful for finding where business successes and liabilities are, along with getting
                analysis on a state-by-state basis. </p>

            <h3>Sanskey Region to Segment</h3>
            <iframe src="sanskey.html" width="100%" height="1000px" style="border:black;"></iframe>
            <p>Our sanskey plot is used to show the flow of profit between regions to states and states to the segment
                of buyer. The key is interactive and allows users to hover over edges between nodes to view what region
                produces the most profit and what demographic of buyer each state benefits from the most. </p>
            <p>In this case, California and New York take up the majority of the traffic in the west and east
                respectively, while other states pick up the rest of the profit. It's also important to note that
                consumer purchases are the Superstore's largest segment of profit, with it being more than both
                corporate and home office purchases combined. Based on the sanskey, it seems it would be particularly
                useful to continue targeting the consumer bases in their big demographics in the east and west to
                maximize profits. </p>
